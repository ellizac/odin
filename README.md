[https://www.theodinproject.com/about]

The Odin Project is a free, open-source coding bootcamp that helps people learn to become full-stack developers. The curriculum is available online and can be studied at one's own pace. The Odin Project was founded in 2013 by Erik Trautman and is maintained by a team of volunteers. 

The Odin Project's curriculum covers a wide range of topics, including:
 - Computer and internet familiarity
 - Setting up a development environment
 - Git and GitHub
 - Front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
 - Back-end technologies
 - Web programming basics 

The Odin Project's curriculum is designed to help people learn coding on their own, regardless of their current experience level. Some say that the curriculum requires hard work and perseverance, but that it's worth it. 
The Odin Project also offers job assistance after graduation and has a Discord community of learners.
