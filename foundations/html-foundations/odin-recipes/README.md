# Odin Recipes
It’s time to practice all of the HTML knowledge you have acquired. In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website.

## Instructions
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
The website won’t look very pretty by the time you’ve finished but it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build your HTML chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.

## Update CSS methods style
<p> How you actually style it is completely open, but you should use the external CSS method (for this practice and moving forward).
You should also try to use several of the properties mentioned in the previous lesson (color, background color, typography properties, etc).
<p> Take some time to play around with the various properties to get a feel for what they do. For now, don’t worry at all about making it look good. This is just to practice and get used to writing CSS, not to make something to show off on your resume.
<p> We haven’t covered how to use a custom font for the font-family property yet, so for now take a look at CSS Fonts for a list of generic font families to use, and CSS Web Safe Fonts for a list of fonts that are web safe. Web safe means that these are fonts that are installed on basically every computer or device (but be sure to still include a generic font family as a fallback).
