    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This single-serve brown butter chocolate chip cookie is my new current obsession. This small batch recipe makes 2 large cookies, and is perfect when you want a cookie but don’t want to make a huge batch! They require minimal ingredients and are ideal for a date or self-love night!

            Brown butter is always superior, in my opinion, and the flavor really shines through in these cookies. The brown butter adds a subtle nutty flavor that really takes these to the next level. Plus I love using a combination of chocolate chips and chunks to create chunks of chocolate and melty pools of chocolate!

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup butter 60 grams</li>
            <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp white sugar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp egg whisked</li>
            <li>splash of vanilla</li>
            <li>1/2 cup + 3 tbsp all-purpose flour 90 grams</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp cornstarch</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chocolate chips or chunks</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 F. Start by browning the butter — add the butter to a pan over medium heat. Stir the butter as it melts. After a few minutes the butter will start to bubble, then will foam up. Once the foam subsides, you'll be left with brown, nutty smelling butter! Pour into a glass container and transfer to the freezer for 10 minutes.
            <li>Once the brown butter has set up a bit, transfer it to a mixing bowl. Add the brown sugar and white sugar and whisk until well combined and smooth.</li>
            <li>Crack one egg into a bowl and whisk until the yolk and whites are combined. Add 2 tablespoons of the mixed egg to the sugar mixture (use the rest of the egg for something else — more cookies or add to an omelet!). Add a splash of vanilla and whisk until the mixture is smooth and combined.</li> 
            <li>Add the flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and pinch of salt. Use a rubber spatula to mix until the dough is just combined.</li>
            <li>Add the chocolate chips or chunks and mix into the dough. Use a 4oz cookie scoop and scoop two large cookies onto a lined baking sheet. If you want, press a few extra pieces of chocolate gently on top of the cookies.</li>
            <li>Bake for 8-10 minutes, until the cookies are just starting to brown on the edges. Remove from the oven and let them cool completely. Top with some flakey salt (optional) and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
