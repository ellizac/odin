                <li>1/4 cup Unsalted Butter, melted</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp Cane Sugar</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp Sea Salt</li>
                
                <h5>Cheesecake Filling</h5>
                <li>16 oz Full Fat Cream Cheese, at room temperature (2 blocks)</li>
                <li>1/2 cup Granulated White Sugar, + 2 tbsp</li>
                <li>2 whole Eggs, at room temperature</li>
                <li>2 tsp Pure Vanilla Extract</li>
                <li>2 cups Hot Water, approx</li>
            </ul>
    
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F and line a 6 inch cake pan with parchment paper on the bottom and sides, or grease a 6x3 springform pan with cooking spray. If using a springform pan, line the outside with aluminum foil.</li>
                <li>Add graham crackers to a food processor and process until they are fine and crumbly. Add butter, sugar, and sea salt and pulse until combined.</li>
                <li>Press the crumb mixture into the bottom and up the sides of the prepared pan.</li>
                <li>Use a stand mixer or an electric mixer to beat together cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl until fluffy.</li>
                <li>Add eggs one at a time, beat until fully incorporated after each one.</li>
                <li>Beat in vanilla extract, scraping down the sides as needed.</li>
                <li>Pour the batter into the pan over the crust. Place the cake pan inside a larger pan (I used an 8x8 pan).</li>
                <li>Add hot water to the larger pan outside until halfway up the cake pan.</li>
                <li>Bake for 70 minutes, until the edges are lightly browned and set, and the center jiggles slightly. You can bake a bit longer (5 minutes at a time) if the cheesecake seems undercooked and too jiggly.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven and let it cool in the water bath completely.</li>
                <li>Once cooled, remove the pan from the water bath, then chill in the fridge for 6 hours to overnight.</li>
                <li> When ready to enjoy, run a knife along the edge of the cheesecake, then unlock the springform pan or gently remove from the cake pan.</li>
                <li>Garnish with your favorite fruits or toppings, if using, then slice and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
